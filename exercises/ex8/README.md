Two strings of bytes A and B are given. Parse the shortest string of those two and build a third string C as follows:
<p>up to the lenght of the shortest string C contains the largest element of the same rank from the two strings</p>
<p>then, up to the length of the longest string C will be filled with 1 and 0, alternatively.</p>
